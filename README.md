# shakespeare-tribute-page
  I developed a responsive tribute page for William Shakespeare using HTML and CSS, designed with a vintage scroll-paper aesthetic. The page presents a concise biography and highlights some of his most renowned works, enhanced with smooth animation effects for a dynamic and engaging user experience. The layout is fully responsive, ensuring seamless accessibility across various screen sizes and devices.
